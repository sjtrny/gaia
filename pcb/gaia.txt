USB Power LED
- 2k(1%) series resistor 5V
- Red LED

3V3 Power Supply
- AMS1117-3.3
- 10uF/25V(10%) Ceramic Cap bypass on INPUT
  - Reccomended by NCP1117 datasheet
- 22uF/25V(10%) Ceramic Cap bypass on OUTPUT
  - Reccomended by AMS1117 and LM1117 datasheet
  - Anything >= 10uF will suffice, with improvements as capacitance is increased
  - ESR from 0.3 Ohm to 2.2 Ohm

USB Connector
